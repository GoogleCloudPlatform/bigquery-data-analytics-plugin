<blockquote>
💡 <strong>Tip — Migrating from Gemini CLI?</strong><br>
If you previously installed this extension with <code>gemini extensions install</code>, you can convert it to an Antigravity plugin instead of reinstalling from scratch:
<ul>
  <li><strong>On first launch of Antigravity CLI</strong>, accept the Migration Options prompt to automatically convert your installed Gemini CLI extensions to Antigravity plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Or, from your terminal</strong>, run:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">agy plugin import gemini</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
See <a href="https://antigravity.google/docs/gcli-migration">Migrating from Gemini CLI</a> for details on plugins, context files (<code>GEMINI.md</code> / <code>AGENTS.md</code>), and MCP server config differences.

## Installing via a compatible Agent Plugins client

This repository is a valid [Agent Plugins](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec) (v1) plugin. Any [Agent Plugins–compatible client](https://agent-plugins.org/compatible-clients) can install it directly using its own built-in plugin command — no extra tooling required — by pointing at this repository:

```
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-data-analytics-plugin
```

Beyond harnesses covered by the native install above, compatible clients include VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Kiro. See your agent's documentation for its exact install command.

**Set env vars:**
Set your environment vars as described in the [configuration section](#configuration).

<!-- {x-release-please-end} -->


> [!NOTE]
> * Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
> * See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for debugging your configuration.


## Authenticating via Application Default Credentials (ADC)

If you prefer to authenticate using local Application Default Credentials instead of the BigQuery connector, add the included `headersHelper` script to your `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "bigquery": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp",
    "headersHelper": "./scripts/adc-headers.sh"
  }
}
```

Ensure you have authenticated locally:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Note for Windows users: Command Prompt and PowerShell cannot execute .sh scripts natively. To use the ADC fallback, you will need to run your agent from a Unix-like terminal such as WSL or Git Bash.

## Usage Examples

Interact with BigQuery using natural language right from your IDE:

* **Find Data:**

  * "Find tables related to PyPi downloads"
  * "Find tables related to Google analytics data in the dataset bigquery-public-data"

* **Generate Analytics and insights:**

  * "Using bigquery-public-data.pypi.file\_downloads show me the top 10 downloaded pypi packages this month."
  * “Using bigquery-public-data.pypi.file\_downloads can you forecast downloads for the last four months of 2025 for package urllib3?”

## Available Tools

The tools come from MCP Toolbox's prebuilt `bigquery` server, grouped into toolsets:

- **data** - Use these tools when you need to handle large-scale data exploration and dataset management. Use when users need to find data assets or run SQL at scale. Provides metadata discovery and query execution across the data warehouse.
- **analytics** - Use these tools when you need to handle advanced data intelligence and predictive tasks. Use when a user asks "why" data changed or needs future projections. Provides automated insight generation and time-series forecasting.

For the full, up-to-date list, see the [`bigquery` prebuilt config](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox/blob/main/internal/prebuiltconfigs/tools/bigquery.yaml)
in the MCP Toolbox repository.

## Generating Skills Instead

The tool-backed skills this plugin used to ship were generated from the same prebuilt
toolsets. If your agent lacks deferred tool loading, or you prefer skills, regenerate
them with the script in this repository:

```bash
VERSION=<toolbox version> ./.github/scripts/generate_skills.sh
```

Use the toolbox version pinned in [`mcp.json`](./mcp.json). A single toolset, without
the script:

```bash
npx @toolbox-sdk/server@<toolbox version> --prebuilt bigquery skills-generate \
  --name "<skill name>" \
  --toolset "<toolset>" \
  --description "<what it is for>"
```

The generated scripts call the toolbox through `npx`, so no binary download is needed.
See [Generate Agent Skills](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox#generate-agent-skills)
in the MCP Toolbox repository.

The hand-authored skills in `skills/` are unaffected and still ship with the plugin.

## Additional Extensions

Find additional extensions to support your entire software development lifecycle at https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions, including:
* [BigQuery Conversational Analytics](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/bigquery-conversational-analytics)
* and more!

## Troubleshooting

Use `gemini --debug` to enable debugging.

Common issues:

* **"failed to find default credentials: google: could not find default credentials."**: Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) are available in your environment. See [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) for more information.
* **"✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed"**: The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
* **"✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn /Users/USER/.gemini/extensions/bigquery-data-analytics/toolbox ENOENT"**: The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure you are using Gemini CLI v0.6.0+.
* **"cannot execute binary file"**: The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded. See [Installing the server](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/introduction/#install-toolbox) for more information.
